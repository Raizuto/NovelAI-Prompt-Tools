# 🎨 NovelAI Prompt Tools

A simple yet powerful Violentmonkey/Tampermonkey userscript designed to supercharge your prompting workflow on NovelAI. This script adds essential features like hotkey-based weight adjustments and intelligent tag autocompletion.

## ✨ Features

-   **🚀 Hotkey Weight Adjustments:** Quickly increase or decrease the emphasis of your tags. Select a word and press a hotkey to wrap it in `1.3::1girl::`, saving you time and effort. **(WARNING: At this time, you CANNOT use this feature on multiple tags at once. I suggest you select them, use the hotkey ONCE, then manually change the number to what you want. Otherwise it just duplicates the tags!)**

-   **🧠 Smart Tag Autocomplete:** Get instant suggestions for danbooru tags as you type (with Latest Artist and Character Tags, both NSFW and SFW).

-   **⚙️ Fully Customizable:** Easily change the hotkeys and weight adjustment values through a clean and simple settings menu to perfectly match your workflow.
